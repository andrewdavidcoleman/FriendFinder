# Friend Finder
### Friend finder is a browser based app that matches people based on their agreement to a series of statements on a scale from 1 to 5.

* The user is brought to a landing page and prompted to click a button to get started.
* They are taken to a survey page where they are presented with a series of statements and asked to rate their agreement with each statement on a scale from 1 to 5.
